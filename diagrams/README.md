### 2. **Class Diagram** (`class-diagram.md`)
- **Purpose**: Illustrates the domain model and class relationships
- **Components**: Domain entities, service layer, controller layer
- **Key Classes**: Order, OrderItem, User, Product, OrderService
- **Coverage**: Object-oriented design and architecture

### 3. **Sequence Diagram - Order Creation** (`sequence-order-creation.md`)
- **Purpose**: Shows the detailed flow of creating a new order
- **Participants**: Client, API, Services, Database
- **Key Steps**: Authentication, validation, calculation, creation, notification
- **Coverage**: Complete order creation workflow

### 4. **Sequence Diagram - Order Management** (`sequence-order-management.md`)
- **Purpose**: Illustrates order management operations
- **Operations**: View orders, update orders, status changes, deletion
- **Access Control**: Admin vs Client permissions
- **Coverage**: All CRUD operations and access patterns

### 5. **Entity Relationship Diagram** (`entity-relationship-diagram.md`)
- **Purpose**: Database schema and entity relationships
- **Entities**: User, Order, OrderItem, Product, Category, etc.
- **Relationships**: One-to-many, many-to-many, foreign keys
- **Coverage**: Complete database design

### 6. **Activity Diagram - Order Workflow** (`activity-order-workflow.md`)
- **Purpose**: Order status lifecycle and state transitions
- **States**: PENDING → CONFIRMED → PROCESSING → SHIPPED → DELIVERED
- **Transitions**: Valid status changes and business rules
- **Coverage**: Complete order lifecycle management

## 🎯 Key Features Covered

### Order Management
- ✅ Order creation with validation
- ✅ Order status tracking and updates
- ✅ Admin order management
- ✅ Client order viewing
- ✅ Order cancellation and deletion

### Business Logic
- ✅ Inventory management
- ✅ Price calculations
- ✅ Shipping information handling
- ✅ Payment processing integration
- ✅ Notification system

### Security & Access Control
- ✅ Role-based authentication
- ✅ Admin vs Client permissions
- ✅ Order ownership validation
- ✅ Secure API endpoints

### Data Management
- ✅ Complete database schema

- ✅ Cascade operations

## 🔄 Order Lifecycle

1. **Creation**: Client creates order → PENDING
2. **Confirmation**: Admin reviews → CONFIRMED
3. **Processing**: Admin processes → PROCESSING
4. **Shipping**: Order shipped → SHIPPED
5. **Delivery**: Order delivered → DELIVERED
6. **Cancellation**: Can be cancelled at any stage

## 📊 System Architecture

### Layers
- **Presentation**: OrderController, AuthMiddleware
- **Business Logic**: OrderService, ProductService, NotificationService
- **Data Access**: OrderRepository, Database
- **Domain**: Order, OrderItem, User, Product entities

### Key Patterns
- **Repository Pattern**: Data access abstraction
- **Service Layer**: Business logic encapsulation
- **Middleware Pattern**: Authentication and authorization
- **Domain Model**: Rich domain objects with business logic

## 🚀 Implementation Notes

### Database
- Uses MySQL with Prisma ORM
- Proper indexing for performance
- Foreign key constraints for integrity
- Cascade deletes for dependent entities

### API Design
